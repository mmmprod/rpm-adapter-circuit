# Repository Verification

## Summary
- **Overall status:** OK — no critical gaps detected in documentation or the bill of materials.
- **Tracked version:** V5.4.12.3 (matches badges and provided BOM).

## Items checked
- **Repository structure:** `docs/` and `bom/` directories present as described in `README.md`.
- **Documentation:** Key files present (`Circuit_RPM_V5_4_12_2.md`, `GUIDE_MONTAGE_V5_4_12_2.md`, `PROTOCOLE_TEST_RPM_V2_7_3.md`, `Objectif_global_circuit_RPM.md`).
- **BOM:** `bom/BOM_V5_4_12_3.md` aligned with the version announced in the README (V5.4.12.3) and marked "VALIDATED".
- **Critical warnings:** Reminders about D1 orientation and exclusive use of 105°C capacitors are present and consistent across README and BOM.

## Recommendation
- No corrective actions required at this time. Keep this verification as a reference point for future audits (version upgrades, BOM or test protocol evolution).
